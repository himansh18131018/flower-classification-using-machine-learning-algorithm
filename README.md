## Image Classification using Python and Machine Learning
### This repo contains the code to perform a simple image classification task using
### Python and Machine Learning. We will apply global feature descriptors such as Color
### Histograms, Haralick Textures and Hu Moments to extract features from FLOWER17
### dataset and use machine learning models to learn and predict.
